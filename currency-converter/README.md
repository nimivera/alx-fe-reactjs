# Currency Converter App ðŸ’±

## Project Overview
This project is a **frontend capstone project** where I am building a simple Currency Converter app using:
- React (with Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Public Currency API (ExchangeRate-API)

The app allows users to:
- Select two currencies (From â†’ To)
- Enter an amount
- Convert between currencies using real-time exchange rates
- Display the conversion result clearly

---

## Features (Planned)
- [x] Project setup with React + Vite
- [x] Installed TailwindCSS
- [ ] Build UI components (`Header`, `CurrencySelector`, `AmountInput`, `ConvertButton`, `ResultDisplay`)
- [ ] Connect to a public currency API
- [ ] Display converted amounts
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Responsive UI design

---

## Current Progress
- âœ… Project environment setup with Vite + React  
- âœ… Installed TailwindCSS (fixing setup issues)  
- âœ… Designed basic components structure  
- ðŸŸ¡ Next step: Finish Tailwind setup, start wiring UI components  

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd currency-converter
